Some useful queries on the database:

Number of hits
select max(id) from hits;

Is dbscan up to date? (aka: is this zero)
select count(*) from dbscan_to_update;

How many clusters are there? (fast)
select count(*) from dbscan where cluster_parent is null and disjoint_rank>0;

Old query (april 1), VERY SLOW, gets ALL tracks EVER, sorted by in-game distance traveled over the course of the track
select * from (select tracks.id as track_id, tracks.dimension, start.x as startx, start.z as startz, last.x as lastx, last.z as lastz, start.x-last.x as dx, start.z-last.z as dz from tracks left outer join hits as start on tracks.first_hit_id=start.id left outer join hits as last on tracks.last_hit_id=last.id) tmp where abs(lastx) > 10 and abs(lastz) > 10 and abs(abs(lastx)-abs(lastz)) > 10 order by dx*dx+dz+dz desc;

Old query (april 4), reasonably fast (<20 seconds), gets all players sorted by the number of times they've logged in. data is heavily skewed by legacy import, and it ends up just showing what players were online for most of the legacy hits in 2018 / 2019.
select players.*, tmp.cnt from (select player_id, count(*) as cnt from player_sessions group by player_id) tmp inner join players on tmp.player_id = players.id order by tmp.cnt desc limit 1000;

Old query (april 5), used in online.sh, gets stats on player, fast
select to_timestamp("join"/1000) as start,to_timestamp("leave"/1000) as end FROM player_sessions WHERE server_id = 1 and player_id=7 order by upper(range) desc limit 10;

April 6, gets the top 50 largest cluster by number of chunks contained, fast
select x*16 as block_x,z*16 as block_z,disjoint_size as num_chunks_in_cluster,dimension,server_id,is_core,cluster_parent,disjoint_rank from dbscan WHERE cluster_parent IS NULL AND disjoint_rank > 0 order by disjoint_size desc limit 50;

April 7, sanity check, should return the same number twice, sums up root sizes and compares to number of child nodes, pretty slow.
begin; select sum(disjoint_size) from dbscan where cluster_parent is null and disjoint_rank>0; select count(*) from dbscan where cluster_parent is not null or is_core; commit;

April 7, sanity check, should return N then N-1. only checks the biggest cluster though! verifies that dbscan properly tagged the size. it may return N then a number lower than N-1 if flattening hasn't happened yet, but this should only be a temporary / transient state. it should never return N then a number â‰¥N. fast.
 select (select max(disjoint_size) from dbscan), (select sum(disjoint_size) from dbscan where cluster_parent = (select id from dbscan order by disjoint_size desc limit 1));

Old query, april 8, don't run, will scan the entire hits table stupidly (ever since i removed the index on hits.created_at)
select (select max(id) from hits where server_id=1) - (select id from hits where server_id=1 and created_at > (extract(epoch from now())*1000)::bigint - 1000*3600 order by created_at asc limit 1);

Good sanity check query, april 11, verifies that every cluster has the same sum of child size as the parent size minus one (because the parent itself counts). this is good because it makes sure that all the cluster merging incremental code is functioning. pretty slow, takes 10 to 20 seconds.
select * from (select sum(disjoint_size) AS children_sizes_sum, cluster_parent from dbscan where cluster_parent is not null group by cluster_parent) parents inner join (select id, disjoint_size from dbscan where cluster_parent is null and disjoint_rank>0) childs on parents.cluster_parent=childs.id where children_sizes_sum + 1 != disjoint_size;

the previous query on steroids, june 29, don't run because it takes forever (40+ seconds). it verifies it at every level of the tree, including leafs. unnecessary tbh.
select * from (select id, disjoint_size from dbscan) childs left outer join (select sum(disjoint_size) AS children_sizes_sum, cluster_parent from dbscan where cluster_parent is not null group by cluster_parent) parents on parents.cluster_parent=childs.id where coalesce(children_sizes_sum, 0) + 1 != disjoint_size;

Simple sanity check on dbscan, april 11, honestly this should be a check constraint, reasonably fast
select count(*) from dbscan where (disjoint_rank!=0 or disjoint_size!=1 or cluster_parent is not null or is_core) and not is_node;

April 15, shows all legacy hits. fast to run.
select * from (select last_hit_id from tracks where legacy) t left outer join hits on hits.id=t.last_hit_id;

april 18, associations, fast
select associations.cluster_id, associations.association, players.username, dbscan.x*16 as block_x, dbscan.z*16 as block_z, dbscan.dimension, dbscan.server_id from associations inner join dbscan on dbscan.id=associations.cluster_id inner join players on players.id=associations.player_id order by association desc;

june 27, find all 8x overworld to nether teleports, takes a few minutes
SELECT older_track.id AS ow_first_track, newer_track.id AS neth_second_track, older_last_hit.x AS ow_chunk_x, older_last_hit.z AS ow_chunk_z, newer_first_hit.x AS neth_chunk_x, newer_first_hit.z AS neth_chunk_z, newer_first_hit.created_at-older_last_hit.created_at AS gap_time_ms, older_last_hit.x*8*16 AS overworld_block_x, older_last_hit.z*8*16 As overworld_block_z FROM tracks AS newer_track INNER JOIN tracks AS older_track ON newer_track.prev_track_id=older_track.id INNER JOIN hits AS newer_first_hit ON newer_first_hit.id=newer_track.first_hit_id INNER JOIN hits AS older_last_hit ON older_last_hit.id=older_track.last_hit_id WHERE newer_track.dimension=-1 AND older_track.dimension=0 AND ABS(newer_first_hit.x-older_last_hit.x)<10 AND ABS(newer_first_hit.z-older_last_hit.z)<10 AND ABS(newer_first_hit.x)>100 AND ABS(newer_first_hit.z)>100 AND ABS(ABS(newer_first_hit.x)-ABS(newer_first_hit.z))>100

may 28, show players that have been kicked & rejoined the most number of times in the last 24 hours
select tmp.cnt as num_kicks, players.username from (select player_id, count(*) as cnt from player_sessions where range && int8range((extract(epoch from now())*1000)::bigint - 1000*3600*24*7, (extract(epoch from now())*1000)::bigint, '[]') group by player_id) tmp inner join players on tmp.player_id = players.id order by tmp.cnt desc;

may 27, heatmap queries
create table heatmap_overworld as (select x,z,count(*) as cnt from hits where server_id=1 and dimension=0 group by x,z);
\copy heatmap_overworld to '/heatmap.csv' delimiter ',' csv;

may 24, The Beautiful Query that locates a player from their username, properly traversing all tables efficiently. postgres is crap, so it can only do 2 without tricking the query planner into doing something stupid.
